# Smart Building Management System

## Overview
This project integrates fire detection, electricity optimization, waste management, and urban air quality monitoring using Arduino Mega and simulates it in Wokwi.

## Features
- Fire and smoke detection with flame sensor and MQ2
- Electricity optimization based on temperature
- Waste management via ultrasonic sensor and servo-controlled bin
- Air quality monitoring using MQ135 and DHT22
- LCD display for real-time updates
- Buzzer for alerts

## Components Used
- Arduino Mega 2560
- Flame Sensor
- MQ2 (Smoke)
- MQ135 (Air Quality)
- DHT22 (Temperature and Humidity)
- Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)
- Servo Motor (SG90)
- Buzzer
- I2C 16x2 LCD Display
- LED (for electricity simulation)
